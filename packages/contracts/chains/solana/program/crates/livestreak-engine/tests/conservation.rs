//! Engine-level conservation spec (the vault-level Sui seed suite lands with the
//! vault module; these pin the streams engine itself, same seeded-walk style).
//!
//! Invariant: every unit deposited is exactly accounted for —
//!   deposits == withdrawals + received + squeezed + remaining balance.
//! Exactness (not tolerance) is the point: the floor-pair streamed_amt makes
//! every split lossless, so conservation must hold to the unit.
