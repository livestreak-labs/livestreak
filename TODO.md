# FlowStream — TODO

> Hackathon deadline: **2026-05-25** (Agora Agents — Canteen/Circle/Arc)
> Judging weights: 30% Agentic Sophistication, 30% Traction, 20% Circle Tools, 20% Innovation

## Contracts

- [x] **Fix `Vault.sol` always-win bug** — Added `creatorSideYes` to VaultData, finalize now compares outcome to creator's staked side.
- [x] **AgentRegistry: add `getAgent()` + `getAgentList()` + `getAgentsByType()`** — Full identity + stats views.
- [x] **ObserverRegistry: add `getObserver()` + `getObserverList()`** — Matching views.
- [x] **SDK ABI mismatch fixed** — `sdk-bookmaker/registry.ts` ABI now matches contract. Added `getLeaderboard()`.
- [x] **SDK Vault ABI synced** — `creatorSideYes` added to abi.ts, reader.ts, types/vault.ts.
- [ ] **Deploy contracts to Arc testnet** — CREATE2 deployment via `deploy/main.ts`. Needs a funded deployer wallet with USDC on Arc testnet.
- [x] **Wire deployed addresses into client via env** — `apps/client/.env` has placeholder addresses, `src/config/contracts.ts` provides shared config. All hooks fall back to mock when addresses are zero. After deployment, just update `.env`.
- [ ] **Wire CLI agent-register bridge to contract** — `cli/bridges/agent-register.ts` is stubbed (logs mock JSON). Needs to actually call `AgentRegistry.registerAgent()` on-chain via the SDK.

---

## Agent Scoring & Registry (ERC-8004)

- [x] **AgentRegistry contract views** — `getAgent()`, `getAgentList()`, `getAgentsByType()` all added.
- [x] **SDK leaderboard query** — `getLeaderboard(filterType?)` fetches all agents, sorts by accuracy.
- [x] **Vault -> AgentRegistry reputation wired** — `finalize()` now correctly records win/loss based on creator's staked side.
- [x] **Client: wire agents page to registry** — `agents.tsx` uses `useAgents()` hook that reads from `AgentRegistry` via viem when deployed, falls back to mock data.
- [ ] **AgentRegistry: add agent metadata** — Currently only stores `name` and `agentType`. Consider adding: `description`, `avatarCid` (IPFS) for richer profiles.
- [ ] **Unify identity systems** — Three separate registries (AgentRegistry, Steward.sol, ObserverRegistry.sol). Consider merging or cross-referencing. Low priority for hackathon.

## Session Keys & Circle Modular Wallets

### Hackathon Path (passkey persistence)
- [x] **Implement passkey auth in React client** — `useCircleWallet` hook, `WalletContext`, `ConnectButton` with Radix Dialog portal.
- [x] **Gasless transactions via paymaster** — `paymaster: true` in `sendUserOperation`.
- [x] **Passkey credential persistence** — Stored in localStorage, auto-restored on mount.
- [x] **Wallet context + hooks** — `useCircleWallet` + `WalletProvider` wrapping app root.
- [x] **Circle Console setup** — Client key in `.env` as `VITE_CIRCLE_CLIENT_KEY` (TEST_CLIENT_KEY prefix).
- [x] **Modal animation** — Radix Dialog with `dialogIn`/`dialogOut` keyframes (opacity + scale + blur).

### Future Path (true session keys via ERC-6900)
- [ ] **Research ERC-6900 SessionKeyPlugin on Arc** — Check Circle Modules Beta Program. Would allow scoped delegation for auto-signing.
- [ ] **Session key UX** — Sign once, stream for 24h without biometric prompts. Ideal but unconfirmed on Arc.

## Client UI (from INTEGRATION.md)

### Priority 1 — Core Demo
- [ ] **Video player** — Replace placeholder `<video>` with real HLS player (`hls.js` or Livepeer).
- [ ] **Observer WebSocket** — Wire `useWebSocket` hook to real observer for live frame data.
- [x] **Vault contract reads** — `useVaults` reads from chain when deployed, falls back to mock with live drift simulation.
- [ ] **Stream slider -> contract** — Wire `onStream` callback to vault `stream()` via Circle wallet `sendUserOperation`.

### Priority 2 — Wallet & Token
- [x] **Wallet connection** — Circle Modular Wallets with passkey auth. USDC balance read.
- [x] **$FLOW balance + staking** — `useFlow` reads from chain when deployed, falls back to mock. Stake/unstake/claim still mock (need wallet write ops).
- [ ] **My Positions panel** — Query user's share balances across vaults. Compute P&L.

### Priority 3 — Discovery & Feed
- [ ] **Protocol stats bar** — Wire `mockProtocolStats` to real data via env placeholder addresses.
- [ ] **Play-by-play feed** — Merge observer WebSocket events + Arc contract events.
- [ ] **Homepage stream discovery** — Build stream discovery API/indexer. Low priority for hackathon.
- [ ] **Lifetime vaults** — Query resolved vaults from Arc using event logs.

---

## File Moves & Cleanup

- [x] **Move client** — `drafts/client/app/` -> `apps/client/`.
- [x] **Move skills** — `drafts/skills/` -> `skills/`.
- [ ] **Clean drafts/** — Remove stale copies from `drafts/` after confirming everything works from final locations.

---

## Submission

- [ ] **Clean git commit** — All files staged, zero commits exist. Need proper initial commit.
- [ ] **Record 3-min demo video** — Show: live stream, vault creation, streaming, hot period, resolution, $FLOW staking, agent leaderboard.
- [ ] **Hackathon submission** — GitHub repo (public) + demo video + submission form.

## Circle Feature Coverage

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Arc Chain | Done | Contracts + SDKs target Arc testnet |
| Agent Wallets | Done | CLI-based via `@circle-fin/cli` |
| Gateway Nanopayments | Done | `sdk-options` wraps `@circle-fin/x402-batching` for observation feed access |
| ERC-8004 | Done | `AgentRegistry.sol` with full views + SDK leaderboard |
| Modular Wallets | Done | Passkey auth + gasless in React client |
| CCTP | Not started | Cross-chain USDC deposits, nice-to-have |
| Paymaster (gasless) | Done | `paymaster: true` via Circle Modular Wallets |

**Current: 6/7 implemented, 0/7 researched, 1/7 not started**
**Target achieved: 6/7 (skipping CCTP)**
